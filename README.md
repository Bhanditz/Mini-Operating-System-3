# Mini-Operating-System

This is a course project for CS-6456 (Fall 2016) Operating Systems.

There are four projects:

1. Thread pool

2. User level thread package (1)

3. User level thread package (2)

4. Mini file system

The projects are meant to implement several basic OS functions: file systems, multi-thread synchronization, CPU scheduling, and memory management.

They were implemented using C and C++, based on Linux, and made use of some Linux user libraries.
